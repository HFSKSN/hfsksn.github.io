## Module's Selected Major Components

The following sections are the selected major components necessary for the Human-Machine Interface module to function. According to the project requirements, this subsystem must have a 3.3 volt switching regulator, a sensor for users to input commands into the interface, and an OLED screen to display data.

### Power Management

(**remove this note/placeholder**: this is where your 3.3 volt switching regulator, any other needed power regulator, and power source {if applicable} **THAT WERE SELECTED**)

For more details, review the ["Appendix - Component Selection Process - Power Mangement"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR314DataSheetTemplate/Appendix/01-Componet-Selection/Component-Selection-Process/#power-management) selection.

### Sensor

**Interface Inputs**
